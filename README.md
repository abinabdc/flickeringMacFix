# flickeringMacFix
Does your macbook screen flicks? Here is the solution.



# Problem scenario
My macbook pro started flickering a while ago, but while watching youtube video or watching 
any video it wasn't flickerinh

# Idea
If I play a video continously on screen then the flickering would stop which is why I decided to make an app that plays a video (an animation) continously
on the menubar (because it is always visible).

# Solution
This app adds a invisible button in your menubar that animates in a infinite loops for with i think 0. something pixel, which stops the flickering.




I recommend not running it in the real time via xcode but creating an app (which you can without a developer profile for mac apps) and then running the app
to witness no lag.

I could have added some animation or atleast made a good readme but sorry I am lazy. 
jk I got shit to do bye
